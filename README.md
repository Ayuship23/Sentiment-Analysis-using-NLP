## 🔍 Key Objectives

- 🧹 Text cleaning: stop words removal, stemming, tokenization
- 🧠 Feature extraction using **Bag of Words** and **TF-IDF**
- 🤖 Sentiment classification using ML algorithms:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Naive Bayes
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- 📊 Model evaluation with metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
- 📈 Visualizations to understand word frequency and sentiment distribution

---

## 🧪 Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Pandas** & **NumPy** – data handling  
- **NLTK** – text preprocessing  
- **Scikit-learn** – feature extraction and model building  
- **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn** – visualization

## 📈 Sample Results

- Achieved **85–90% accuracy** using Logistic Regression and SVM.
- Positive reviews dominate the dataset, but the classifier handles both classes effectively.
- Frequent words include "love", "great", "easy", indicating overall satisfaction.

## ⚙️ How to Run

1. Clone the repository  
2. Install required packages using:  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
3.Open sentiment_analysis_alexa.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook

4. Run all cells to preprocess data, train models, and view predictions

🚀 Future Improvements
Use deep learning models like LSTM or BERT for improved accuracy

Build a Streamlit web app for real-time sentiment analysis

Expand to multi-class sentiment (e.g., very positive, neutral, very negative)
